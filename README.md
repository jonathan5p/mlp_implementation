# MLP

Full implementation of a fully connected neural network from scratch with SGD and Adam optimizers. The project was tested on a binary classification problem where we want to identify a specific type of particle. Auxiliar functions are supply to test with different kinds of preprocessing such as standardization, normalization or principal component analysis.
